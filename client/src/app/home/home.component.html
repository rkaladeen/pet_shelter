The button can be re-enabled by refreshing or otherwise reloading the component.</li><li>Do not allow duplicate pet names in the database. Display an error message if the user attempts to create a pet with a name that already exists in the database.</li><li>Sort the pets by type so that all the dogs are listed together, all the rabbits together, and so on.</li><li>Maintain the validations for creating a pet when editing a pet. Display error messages if requirements are not met when editing.</li></ul></li></ul>
